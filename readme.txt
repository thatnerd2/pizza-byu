Shelved for now.

Thought it would be nice to have a pizza delivery service on BYU campus.  I proposed this to the Product manager of Cougar Cash, since if anything was going to give, it would be CC first.

The Product manager told me that they had considered the possibility, and it was still in the works.  I built this demo in case an intermediate form was required (students CC to me, my cash to pizza companies, pizza to students.).  For now, it's the administration's move.

Feel free to run wild with this project - code is all yours.  Currently it's planning on using Domino's API to do delivery, uses BYU CAS to authenticate Net ID, and uses Semantic UI for a clean look.

If you are planning on running with this, let me know, out of my own curiosity.
